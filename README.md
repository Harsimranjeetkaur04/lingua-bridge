# LinguaBridge 🌍🧠

LinguaBridge is a lightweight and efficient toolkit designed for **language detection** and **text translation** tasks.  
It is built with multilingual applications in mind, utilizing a blend of statistical methods and deep learning models to accurately analyze and translate text across a wide range of languages.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Fast and reliable language detection powered by pretrained models  
- 🔁 Translation capabilities planned for multiple languages in upcoming releases  
- 📊 Provides confidence scores to gauge the accuracy of predictions  
- 🧪 Optimized for both batch processing and real-time text analysis

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- Language Detection is implemented using the `fastText` pretrained model  
- Translation support is under development, aiming to integrate with advanced models like `transformers`, `MarianMT`, or `M2M100`
