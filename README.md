## Key Features

* **Advanced Data Processing**: Efficiently collects and preprocesses large QA datasets. Includes robust tokenization, context segmentation, and input formatting tailored for transformer models.
* **State-of-the-Art Models**: Fine-tunes pre-trained T5 and BERT models on domain-specific data using the HuggingFace `transformers` library.
* **High Performance**: Utilizes GPU acceleration for faster training cycles and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
* **Robust Evaluation**: Measures model performance using standard metrics like **Exact Match (EM)** and **F1-Score**, demonstrating strong contextual understanding.
* **Ready for Deployment**: The trained model is packaged with a simple API interface (e.g., using Flask/FastAPI) for real-time question submission and answer retrieval. Supports batch queries and response caching for enhanced efficiency.
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed notes on the entire pipeline, from data preparation to evaluation results.

## How It Works

The system follows a standard pipeline for building a modern NLP-powered QA system:

1.  **Data Preparation**: A large corpus of context-question-answer triplets is collected and preprocessed. The text is tokenized into a format that BERT/T5 can understand.
2.  **Model Fine-Tuning**: The pre-trained models are loaded from HuggingFace and fine-tuned on the prepared dataset. This step adjusts the model's weights to specialize in the task of question answering on the specific domain.
3.  **Inference API**: The fine-tuned model is saved and served via a lightweight web API.
4.  **User Interaction**: A user sends a `POST` request containing a `question` and `context` to the API endpoint.
5.  **Answer Generation**: The model processes the input and returns the most likely answer found within the context.

## Requirements

The project relies on several key Python libraries. The full list can be found in `requirements.txt`.

* `torch`
* `transformers`
* `datasets`
* `tokenizers`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `flask` or `fastapi` (for API)
* `tqdm`

## Installation

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the API and start asking questions.

1.  **Start the API Server:**
    Run the main application file (e.g., `app.py`) to start the server.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The server will typically start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Send a Query:**
    You can use `cURL` or any API client to send a question and its context to the `/ask` endpoint.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST [http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask](http://127.0.0.1:5000/ask) \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
               "question": "Which metrics are used for evaluation?",
               "context": "This project measures model performance using standard metrics like Exact Match (EM) and F1-Score, demonstrating strong contextual understanding."
             }'
    ```

3.  **Expected Response:**
    The API will return a JSON object with the answer.
    ```json
    {
      "answer": "Exact Match (EM) and F1-Score"
    }
    ```

## Model Training & Evaluation

For users interested in reproducing the results or fine-tuning the model on their own data.

1.  **Prepare Your Data**:
    Ensure your dataset (e.g., `train.json`, `test.json`) is in the correct format and placed in the `/data` directory.

2.  **Run the Training Script**:
    Execute the training script, specifying hyperparameters as needed.
    ```bash
    python train.py --model_name "t5-base" --epochs 3 --batch_size 8 --learning_rate 3e-5
    ```

3.  **Run the Evaluation Script**:
    After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --model_path "/path/to/your/fine-tuned-model" --test_file "data/test.json"
    ```
    The script will output the **EM** and **F1-Score**.

## Roadmap

This project is actively being developed. Future plans include:

-   [ ] **Multi-lingual Support**: Extend the models and datasets to handle questions in languages other than English.
-   [ ] **Frontend Interface**: Develop a simple web-based UI (using Streamlit or Gradio) for easier user interaction.
-   [ ] **Knowledge Distillation**: Explore model compression techniques like knowledge distillation to create lighter, faster models suitable for edge devices.
-   [ ] **Containerization**: Add a `Dockerfile` for easy deployment and scalability.
